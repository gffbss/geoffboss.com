		            <p>For a long time now, I've been meaning to become a better cook. I have an obsession with pizza, and so finally I realized the answer was to start making pizza. I’ve homemade pizza for several years now, but always as sort of an afterthought. First we started getting Trader Joes premade dough, and we’d roll those out and load them up with whatever we felt like. So that was the extent of my experience in Pizza. A happy consumer of pies but a less than thoughtful producer of pies.

		            	When the shelter in place hit in March 2020, Julie bought me a book called Pizza Camp, and I started to dream in Pizza. That is the origin story of this page. As of writing this intro I’ve made three pizzas from scratch that were actually pretty good. But I recognize there is so much to learn and so I set the goal of making 100 pies. Documenting helps keep me accountable, and serves as a place that I can reference later. This is an historical ledger basically of my path to pizza glory!

                	<p>Changed the ingredients a bit as we ran out, but still shopping at Whole Foods. Eventually, I want to focus on more organic ingredients when things start to get back to normal. For this pie, I wanted to make something with broccoli, so I went to whole foods and got fresh broccoli and two new cheeses. Di Stefano Mozzarella which was whole milk and I was basically filtering for whole milk. Then I picked up some provolone. I should have used another mozzarella but didn't. At home I tossed a good amount of thinly sliced yellow onions with olive oil, salt and pepper and then baked them at 475 for 20 minutes. We have a food processor and so I blended the onions into the sauce we made for pie #1 & #2. It was a really nice touch and we used more sauce then we did for the first two pies.</p>

                	<p>I realized that the flour I have from Ibis is a Red Wheat flour. Also we don’t have any yeast at the moment so the crust is nowhere near a finished product. It’s actually good, but it’s crunchy and you can’t fold the pizza without breaking the slice in half. I put an order in for some Pizza flower from Anson Mills in SC (https://ansonmills.com/products). Our pizza stone is 14 inches so I am consistently making smaller pies, like 12  inches. I want bigger ones! So for this attempt we used sliced brussel sprouts and mushrooms. It got a bit more char on it than I probably would want in the future but I enjoyed this one and felt like it was an improvement on the previous pie.</p>
                	<p>Here is the pie:</p>

                	<p>A few weeks back I ordered some flour from this rad coffee shop and bakery I visited in Kansas City called Messenger. I was actually on their site to order coffee beans but they were also selling flower from the bakery they partner with called Ibis (https://www.ibisbakery.com/). Ibis mills their own flour! So we had two three pound bags arrive and I needed something to do with them. Cue the pizza adventure!</p>
                	<p>Two things happened in this first attempt at homemade pie that changed me forever. For the first time ever I premade sauce. And about 5 minutes into the bake, I switched the oven to broil. We have a pizza stone so the pie continues to cook, but the broil is game changing. I can now get the char that makes it feel like real pizza. Those two tips came from Joe Beddias book, Pizza Camp, which is now my bible.</p>
                	<p>So I used canned San Marzano tomatoes but they were not entirely crushed. I kinda liked that, having some small sliced tomatoes in the sauce. I crushed a few cloves of garlic and added salt and sugar. Now for the dough. No yeast so I used baking powder. I mixed the Ibis wheat flour with salt, coconut sugar, baking powder, and extra virgin olive oil. I worked the dough for a few minutes and then let it sit for about 15 minutes with a wet towel on top. For toppings, I used whole foods mozzarella (sliced it) and italian blend cheese. Added some sliced pancetta and Jeffs Pepperoncinis. I baked that thing at around 475 for about 15 minutes. As mentioned earlier, roughly 5 minutes in the oven before switching to broil for the remaining ten. It was yummy though the crust was a bit too thick in consistency.</p>
