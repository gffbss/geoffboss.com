		            	What a wild year 2020 was. It was the year of the word <b>bizarre</b>. I said that word more times than I could possibly count. One of a small number of highlights though, was this pizza journey. After all when one spends an inordinate amount of time in their apartment, they might as well learn something about cooking.
		            	Keep in mind, there is a spell there where I got pretty lazy and didn't have much to write in addition to the bakes. So like 44 - 70 you are just getting some photos of pizza.

		            	One this is clear to me after wrapping the 100 pizza project. I kept on getting better and better. More creative, more freedom, and more fun. And the pizzas were simply wonderful. I look forward to all that is ahead.

                	<p>
		            	I think my favorites were the bakes wherein lessons were learned. Beyond those bakes, there were two distinct sessions that I simply loved. The Barbeque Bake where there was plenty of improvisation, and the final bake.

            		<p>CALZONE BB</p>
            		<p>I froze a dough ball back in November as a test to see if it was possible and would even be edible later on. I am happy to report that while I chose to craft a calzone, it remained a tasty treat! Inspired by a post I had seen, I pulled the dough ball out of the freezer and let it sit in the fridge for a day. I rolled it out like I would when prepping a pizza and then just added my accoutrements to half the pie. I threw in fresh mozzarella, asparagus, grilled white onion, grilled mushrooms and topped with oregano and some olive oil. It turned out pretty darn good!  </p>            
            		<p>Here is the calzone:</p>
